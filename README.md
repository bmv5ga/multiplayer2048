multiplayer2048
===============

This is a multiplayer 2048 game which allows two players to interact with the same 2048 tile board. I improved the user interface to be more colorful. Additionally, I added in two new features. A restart confirmation dialog and an undo button which can be used once per game to reverse the last move. The two players take turns controlling the board, one with the wasd keys and the other with the arrow keys. This allows two game modes to be played. One where both players work together to try and beat the game and the other where one player is trying to win while the other is trying to lose.
